        <p><b>What if I told you...</b></p>
        <p>That true greatness isn't measured at Augusta or St. Andrews... but at a riverside casino golf course tucked away in the Midwest.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Welcome to the Rising Star Classic</b> — 36 holes, two grueling competitions, one legendary day. A battle of stamina, questionable judgment, and the kind of raw talent that can only be fueled by gas station breakfast sandwiches and sheer willpower. Championships are not just won here — they are survived.</p>
